mirror of https://1vwjbxf1wko0yhnr.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/overclocking-tools-for-nvidia-gpus-suck-i-made-my-own/ - site hasn't been updated in over 4 years so I'm mirroring it so the code isn't lost. Archived version available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180221193221/https://1vwjbxf1wko0yhnr.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/overclocking-tools-for-nvidia-gpus-suck-i-made-my-own/).

**Only** works on pre-1xxx series Nvidia GPUs.

The usage syntax is `overclock.exe GPU_CLOCK VRAM_CLOCK` i.e. `overclock.exe 135 250` for a 135MHz GPU overclock and 250MHz GPU VRAM overclock.
